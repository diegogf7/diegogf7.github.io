    "The stars are tiny points of light in the space. On a clear night we can see around 2,000 to 3,000 stars without using a telescope. Stars look tiny in the sky because they are far away from the Earth. In ancient times the sky watchers found patterns of stars in the sky.These astronauts Neil Armstrong and patterns of people and the creatures from the myths and the legends. As the Earth spins from east to west the stars also appear to cross from east to west. The stars are made up of gases."
