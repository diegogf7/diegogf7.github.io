    <p id="text"> Hi I'm the creator of stammr and I'm a 13-year-old boy named Diego.</p>
        <p>A few years back I started to face stuttering, and I struggled to even get a few words out at time</p>
        <p> Through learning techniques and exercises I was able to overcome stuttering, and I wanted to create this website in order to help others through stuttering. </p>
        <p> I hope that this website is able to help you, but remember stuttering won't simply go away, it takes time, but though hard work and determination you will overcome it. </p>
