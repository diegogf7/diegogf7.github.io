<h1>Who are the creators of stammr?</h1>
<p> Hi I'm the creator of stammr and I'm a 13-year-old boy named Diego.</p>
<p>A few years back I started to face stuttering, and I struggled to even get a few words out at time</p>
<p> Through learning techniques and exercises I was able to overcome stuttering, and I wanted to create this website in order to help others through stuttering. </p>
