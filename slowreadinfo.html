        <p class="card-text" id="text">Slow speech is one if not the most common strategies used to combat stuttering. As in the name slow speech is a strategy, that requires you to decrease your speech rate, and by doing so it makes a big impact! When you speak slowly the amount of stress built up in your vocal cords decreases. Stress is one of the main factors to stuttering, so by reducing it you can become much more fluent.</p>
